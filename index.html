	<h1>Linking and Navigation ^^</h1>
	<h2 id="URL">URLs^^</h2>
		<p>A Uniform Resource Locator, colloquially known as an address on the Web, is a reference to a resource that specifies its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it. A URL is a specific type of Uniform Resource Identifier, although many people use the two terms interchangeably.</p>
	<h2 id="SourceAnchors">SourceAnchors^^</h2>
		<p>The sourceAnchor attribute is defined as an attribute immutable during the lifetime of an object. It uniquely identifies an object as being the same object on-premises and in Microsoft Entra ID. The attribute is also called immutableId and the two names are used interchangeably.</p>
	<h2 id="DestinationAnchors">DestinationAnchors^^</h2>
		<p>A link has two ends -- called anchors -- and a direction. The link starts at the "source" anchor and points to the "destination" anchor, which may be any Web resource (e.g., an image, a video clip, a sound bite, a program, an HTML document, an element within an HTML document, etc.).</p>
	<h2 id="Examples">Examples^^</h2>
		<p>Examples help you clarify complex concepts, even in regulations. They are an ideal way to help your readers. In spoken English, when you ask for clarification of something, people often respond by giving you an example. Good examples can substitute for long explanations.</p>
